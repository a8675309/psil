# Risp
**Risp** is a Lisp-like programming language implemented in Rust. Currently a work-in-progress.

[Limp](https://github.com/eric-unc/limp) was the prototype for Risp and uses code from it. This project has no relation to [this blog post](https://stopa.io/post/222), except for me copying it a bit after discovering it.
